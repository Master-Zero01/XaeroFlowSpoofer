# XaeroFlowSpoofer Configuration
# =========================================================
# Controls client-side visual spoofing of fluids and surface blocks.
# This affects *only* how blocks appear to players — the real world data is untouched.
# =========================================================

# --- Fluid Spoofing ---
# Chance (0.0–1.0) that a water or lava block in an outgoing packet
# will appear as air to the player (visual desync).
spoof-chance: 0.12

# Restrict fluid spoofing to blocks near the edges of chunks.
# Recommended: true for realism, false to allow random spoofing anywhere.
only-chunk-edges: true

# Distance in blocks from the chunk edge within which spoofing can occur.
# Set higher (2–4) to enlarge the edge zone, or 0 to disable the restriction.
edge-distance: 1

# --- Terrain Visual Noise ---
# Enables small random variations in surface materials to create
# the illusion of terrain instability or interference.
enable-fake-terrain: true

# Chance (0.0–1.0) that any visible block in a changed section
# will be visually replaced with a random surface material.
# Recommended: 0.05–0.15. Higher values make more visible noise.
terrain-noise-chance: 0.08
